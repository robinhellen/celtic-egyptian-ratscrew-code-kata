# Game rules

## Overview
Celtic Egyptian Ratscrew is basically snap, but with a few extra rules.

The object of the game is to accrue all the cards from the deck into your hand. Play proceeds clockwise around the circle of players, with each player laying a card onto the centre stack and calling out a sequence number: the first card is 1 (or “ace”), the second card is 2, up until the 11th card which can be called 11 or “jack”. The counting is reset to 1/”ace” on the 14th card. Any player may call snap on any player’s turn to win the stack, like in classic Snap, although the snap rule is more complex and explained later. A player incorrectly snapping the stack incurs a penalty, preventing that player from calling snap again until another player has won the stack.

## Rules
### Preparation
* An entire deck of cards is dealt out to the players as fairly as possible (some people may have one more card than others).
* Players keep their cards in a pile, face-down in front them.

### Order of play
* The player that was dealt the first card starts the game, and play continues in a clockwise direction.
* On each turn, the player takes the  top card from their pile and lays it on the *stack*, while at the same time *calling out* the card they are currently on. *Calling out* is explained later.
* A player who plays out of turn incurs a *penalty* (see below).
* At any point during the game any player may *snap* the *stack*.

### Winning conditions
To win, a player must have all the cards in their pile.

### Snaps
If you perform a valid *snap*, you pick up the the cards the *stack* and add them, face-down, to the bottom of your pile. It then becomes your turn.
If you perform an invalid *snap*, you incur a *penalty* (see below).

#### Types of valid snaps
* *Calling out*: The rank of the card that was last *laid* matches the one that was *called out* by the player who *laid* that card
* *Standard*: There are two cards of the same rank (e.g. 2 tens, 2 Jacks) next to each other anywhere in the *stack*
* *Sandwich*: There is a *sandwich* somewhere in the *stack*. A sandwich is where there are two cards of the same rank with exactly one other card of any rank between them, e.g. [1, 2, 1], [2, 1, 2], [1, 3, 1].
* *Dark queen*: The top card is the queen of spades.
* *Counting out*: It is also valid to snap if the *counting out* rules below have been satisfied, i.e. we've counted down from the *counting out value* of the picture card to 0.

### Calling out
Each time any player *lays* a card, they must also *call out*, as follows:
* For first card *laid* in the game, they *call* "1" or "ace"
* For the second card, the player *calls* "2"
* ...
* And so on until the 11th card in the game, when the player *calls* "11" or "jack"
* On the 12th card, the player *calls* "12" or "queen"
* On the 13th card, the player *calls* "13" or "king"
* On the 14th card, they start again, *calling* "1" or "ace"
* etc

### Counting out
*Counting out* is another way of *winning* the *stack*. *Counting out* happens whenever someone *lays* a picture card (a Jack, Queen, King or Ace), like this:
* When a picture card is *laid*, the *counting out value* is started at the value shown below.
* Each time someone correctly *lays* a card, the *counting out value* is reduced by 1.
* If the *counting out value* is 0 and there are no other valid *snaps* available, then the person who played the original picture card *wins* the *stack* as if they *snapped* it. If there are valid *snaps*, then the first player to *snap* wins the *stack*.
* If the *counting out* rule is active and a new picture card is *laid*, then a new *counting out* phase starts, displacing the old one.

| Card  | Value |
| ------|:-----:|
| Ace   | 4     |
| King  | 3     |
| Queen | 2     |
| Jack  | 1     |

### Penalty
A player with a *penalty* is not allowed to attempt a *snap* on the current *stack*. The *penalty* remains in place until another player has *won* the *stack*.
