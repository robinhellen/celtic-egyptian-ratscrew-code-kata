# Starting point for the Celtic-Egyptian-Ratscrew card game, as a series of code katas.

The rules for the game itself can be found in the `rules.md` file.

This problem is split up into a series of katas. The instructions for each kata can be found in the relevant `kataX.md` file. Work from these, referring back to the rules for the game when needed.
